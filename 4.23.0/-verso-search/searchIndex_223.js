It is more\nefficient because it avoids an allocation.\n\nOrdering of optional values typically uses the DecidableEq (Option α), LT (Option α), Min (Option α), and Max (Option α) instances.\n\nThe minimum of two optional values, with none treated as the least element. This function is\nusually accessed through the Min (Option α) instance, rather than directly.Prior to nightly-2025-02-27, none was treated as the greatest element, so\nmin none (some x) = min (some x) none = some x.Examples:* Option.min (some 2) (some 5) = some 2* Option.min (some 5) (some 2) = some 2* Option.min (some 2) none = none* Option.min none (some 5) = none* Option.min none none = none\n\nThe maximum of two optional values.This function is usually accessed through the Max (Option α) instance, rather than directly.Examples:* Option.max (some 2) (some 5) = some 5* Option.max (some 5) (some 2) = some 5* Option.max (some 2) none = some 2* Option.max none (some 5) = some 5* Option.max none none = none\n\nLifts an ordering relation to Option, such that none is the least element.It can be understood as adding a distinguished least element, represented by none, to both α and\nβ.This definition is part of the implementation of the LT (Option α) instance. However, because it\ncan be used with heterogeneous relations, it is sometimes useful on its own.Examples:* Option.lt (fun n k : Nat => n < k) none none = False* Option.lt (fun n k : Nat => n < k) none (some 3) = True* Option.lt (fun n k : Nat => n < k) (some 3) none = False* Option.lt (fun n k : Nat => n < k) (some 4) (some 5) = True* Option.lt (fun n k : Nat => n < k) (some 4) (some 4) = False\n\nEquality with none is decidable even if the wrapped type does not have decidable equality.This is not an instance because it is not definitionally equal to the standard instance of\nDecidableEq (Option α), which can cause problems. It can be locally bound if needed.Try to use the Boolean comparisons Option.isNone or Option.isSome instead.\n\n"}});
