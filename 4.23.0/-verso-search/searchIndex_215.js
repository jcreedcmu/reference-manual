Promises","context":"Lean Reference\u0009IO\u0009Tasks and Threads","contents":"Promises represent a value that will be supplied in the future.\nSupplying the value is called resolving the promise.\nOnce created, a promise can be stored in a data structure or passed around like any other value, and attempts to read from it will block until it is resolved.\n\nPromise α allows you to create a Task α whose value is provided later by calling resolve.Typical usage is as follows:1. let promise ← Promise.new creates a promise2. promise.result? : Task (Option α) can now be passed around3. promise.result?.get blocks until the promise is resolved4. promise.resolve a resolves the promise5. promise.result?.get now returns some aIf the promise is dropped without ever being resolved, promise.result?.get will return none.\nSee Promise.result!/resultD for other ways to handle this case.\n\nCreates a new Promise.\n\nChecks whether the promise has already been resolved, i.e. whether access to result* will return\nimmediately.\n\nLike Promise.result, but resolves to none if the promise is dropped without ever being resolved.\n\nThe result task of a Promise.The task blocks until Promise.resolve is called. If the promise is dropped without ever being\nresolved, evaluating the task will panic and, when not using fatal panics, block forever. As\nPromise.result! is a pure value and thus the point of evaluation may not be known precisely, this\nmeans that any promise on which Promise.result! may be evaluated must be resolved eventually.\nWhen in doubt, always prefer Promise.result? to handle dropped promises explicitly.\n\nLike Promise.result, but resolves to dflt if the promise is dropped without ever being resolved.\n\nResolves a Promise.Only the first call to this function has an effect.\n\n"},"/IO/Mutable-References/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--IO--Mutable-References--State-Transformers--Comparisons":{"id":"/IO/Mutable-References/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--IO--Mutable-References--State-Transformers--Comparisons","header":"15.4.1.2.

The logical model of the natural numbers is as an inductive type, and arithmetic operations are specified using this model. In Lean's kernel, the interpreter, and compiled code, closed natural numbers are represented as efficient arbitrary-precision integers. Sufficiently small numbers are values that don't require indirection through a pointer. Arithmetic operations are implemented by primitives that take advantage of the efficient representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}});
