Reducing Terms","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Interacting with Lean","contents":"The #reduce command repeatedly applies reductions to a term until no further reductions are possible.\nReductions are performed under binders, but to avoid unexpected slowdowns, proofs and types are skipped unless the corresponding options to #reduce are enabled.\nUnlike #eval command, reduction cannot have side effects and the result is displayed as a term rather than via a ToString or Repr instance.\n\nGenerally speaking, #reduce is primarily useful for diagnosing issues with definitional equality and proof terms, while #eval is more suitable for computing the value of a term.\nIn particular, functions defined using well-founded recursion or as partial fixpoints are either very slow to compute with the reduction engine, or will not reduce at all.\n\nReducing Terms#reduce <expression> reduces the expression <expression> to its normal form. This\ninvolves applying reduction rules until no further reduction is possible.By default, proofs and types within the expression are not reduced. Use modifiers\n(proofs := true)  and (types := true) to reduce them.\nRecall that propositions are types in Lean.Warning: This can be a computationally expensive operation,\nespecially for complex expressions.Consider using #eval <expression> for simple evaluation/execution\nof expressions.\n\nReducing FunctionsReducing a term results in its normal form in Lean's logic.\nBecause the underlying term is reduced and then displayed, there is no need for a ToString or Repr instance.\nFunctions can be displayed just as well as any other term.In some cases, this normal form is short and resembles a term that a person might write:#reduce (fun x => x + 1)\nfun x => x.succ\nIn other cases, the details of the elaboration of functions such as addition to Lean's core logic are exposed:#reduce (fun x => 1 + x)\nfun x => (Nat.rec ⟨fun x => x, PUnit.unit⟩ (fun n n_ih => ⟨fun x => (n_ih.1 x).succ, n_ih⟩) x).1 1\n\n\n"},"/Error-Explanations/lean___inductiveParamMissing/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Error-Explanations--lean___inductiveParamMissing--Examples":{"id":"/Error-Explanations/lean___inductiveParamMissing/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Error-Explanations--lean___inductiveParamMissing--Examples","header":"Examples","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Error Explanations\u0009lean.inductiveParamMissing","contents":"Omitting parameter in argument to higher-order predicateinductive List.All {α : Type u} (P : α → Prop) : List α → Prop\n  | nil : All P []\n  | cons {x xs} : P x → All P xs → All P (x :: xs)\n\nstructure RoseTree (α : Type u) where\n  val : α\n  children : List (RoseTree α)\n\ninductive RoseTree.All {α : Type u} (P : α → Prop) (t : RoseTree α) : Prop\n  | intro : P t.val → List.All (All P) t.children → All P t\nMissing parameter(s) in occurrence of inductive type: In the expression\n  List.All (All P) t.children\nfound\n  All P\nbut expected all parameters to be specified:\n  All P t\n\nNote: All occurrences of an inductive type in the types of its constructors must specify its fixed parameters.
