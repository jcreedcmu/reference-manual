Used by a package to specify some code which should be run after a successful lake update of the package or one of its downstream dependencies. (lake#185)* Improvements to Lake startup time (#2572, #2573)* refine e now replaces the main goal with metavariables which were created during elaboration of e and no longer captures pre-existing metavariables that occur in e (#2502).* This is accomplished via changes to withCollectingNewGoalsFrom, which also affects elabTermWithHoles, refine', calc (tactic), and specialize. Likewise, all of these now only include newly-created metavariables in their output.* Previously, both newly-created and pre-existing metavariables occurring in e were returned inconsistently in different edge cases, causing duplicated goals in the infoview (issue #2495), erroneously closed goals (issue #2434), and unintuitive behavior due to refine e capturing previously-created goals appearing unexpectedly in e (no issue; see PR).\n\n"},"/Tactic-Proofs/The-Tactic-Language/#tactic-config":{"id":"/Tactic-Proofs/The-Tactic-Language/#tactic-config","header":"13.3.5.

Automatic Toolchain Updates","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Build Tools\u0009Lake\u0009Command-Line Interface","contents":"The update command checks for changes to dependencies, fetching their sources and updating the manifest accordingly.\nBy default, update also attempts to update the root package's toolchain file when a new version of a dependency specifies an updated toolchain.\nThis behavior can be disabled with the --keep-toolchain flag.\n\nIf multiple dependencies specify newer toolchains, Lake selects the newest compatible toolchain, if it exists.\nTo determine the newest compatible toolchain, Lake parses the toolchain listed in the packages' lean-toolchain files into four categories:* Releases, which are compared by version number (e.g., v4.4.0 < v4.8.0 and v4.6.0-rc1 < v4.6.0)* Nightly builds, which are compared by date (e.g., nightly-2024-01-10 < nightly-2024-10-01)* Builds from pull requests to the Lean compiler, which are incomparable* Other versions, which are also incomparableToolchain versions from multiple categories are incomparable.\nIf there is not a single newest toolchain, Lake will print a warning and continue updating without changing the toolchain.\n\nIf Lake does find a new toolchain, then it updates the workspace's lean-toolchain file accordingly and restarts the update using the new toolchain's Lake.\nIf Elan is detected, it will spawn the new Lake process via elan run with the same arguments Lake was initially run with.\nIf Elan is missing, it will prompt the user to restart Lake manually and exit with a special error code (namely, 4).\nThe Elan executable used by Lake can be configured using the ELAN environment variable.\n\n"}});
