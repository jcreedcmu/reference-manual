Hygiene","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Notations and Macros\u0009Macros","contents":"A macro is hygienic if its expansion cannot result in identifier capture.\nIdentifier capture is when an identifier ends up referring to a binding site other than that which is in scope where the identifier occurs in the source code.\nThere are two types of identifier capture:\n\n* If a macro's expansion introduces binders, then identifiers that are parameters to the macro may end up referring to the introduced binders if their names happen to match.* If a macro's expansion is intended to refer to a name, but the macro is used in a context that either locally binds this name or in which a new global name has been introduced, it may end up referring to the wrong name.\n\nThe first kind of variable capture can be avoided by ensuring that every binding introduced by a macro uses a freshly generated, globally-unique name, while the second can be avoided by always using fully-qualified names to refer to constants.\nThe fresh names must be generated again at each invocation of the macro to avoid variable capture in recursive macros.\nThese techniques are error-prone.\nVariable capture issues are difficult to test for because they rely on coincidences of name choices, and consistently applying these techniques results in noisy code.\n\nLean features automatic hygiene: in almost all cases, macros are automatically hygienic.\nCapture by introduced bindings is avoided by annotating identifiers introduced by a macro with macro scopes, which uniquely identify each invocation of macro expansion.\nIf the binding and the use of the identifier have the same macro scopes, then they were introduced by the same step of macro expansion and should refer to one another.\nSimilarly, uses of global names in code generated by a macro are not captured by local bindings in the context in which they are expanded because these use sites have macro scopes that are not present in the binding occurrence.\nCapture by newly-introduced global names is prevented by annotating potential global name references with the set of global names that match at quotation time in code produced in the macro's body.\nIdentifiers annotated with potential referents are called pre-resolved identifiers, and the Syntax.Preresolved field on the Syntax.ident constructor is used to store the potential referents.\nDuring elaboration, if an identifier has pre-resolved global names associated with it, then other global names are not considered as valid reference targets.\n\nThe introduction of macro scopes and pre-resolved identifiers to generated syntax occurs during quotation.\nMacros that construct syntax by other means than quotation should also ensure hygiene by some other means.\nFor more details on Lean's hygiene algorithm, please consult .\n\n"},"/Functors___-Monads-and--do--Notation/Varieties-of-Monads/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Functors___-Monads-and--do--Notation--Varieties-of-Monads--Combined-Error-and-State-Monads":{"id":"/Functors___-Monads-and--do--Notation/Varieties-of-Monads/#The-Lean-Language-Reference--Functors___-Monads-and--do--Notation--Varieties-of-Monads--Combined-Error-and-State-Monads","header":"14.5.8.
