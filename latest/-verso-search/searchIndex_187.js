What is congruence closure?","context":"Lean Reference\u0009The  grind  tactic\u0009Congruence Closure","contents":"Congruence closure maintains equivalence classes of terms under the reflexive–symmetric–transitive closure of \"is equal to\" and the rule that equal arguments yield equal function results.  Formally, if a = a' and b = b', then f a b = f a' b' is added.  The algorithm merges classes until a fixed point is reached.\n\nThink of a shared white‑board:\n\n1. Every hypothesis h : t₁ = t₂ writes a line connecting t₁ and t₂.2. Each merge paints both terms the same color.  Soon whole constellations (f a, g (f a), …) share the color.3. If True and False ever land in the same color—or likewise two different constructors of the same inductive type such as none and some 1—the goal is closed by contradiction.\n\n"}});
