Performance Notes","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Basic Types\u0009Natural Numbers\u0009Run-Time Representation","contents":"Using Lean's built-in arithmetic operators, rather than redefining them, is essential.\nThe logical model of Nat is essentially a linked list, so addition would take time linear in the size of one argument.\nStill worse, multiplication takes quadratic time in this model.\nWhile defining arithmetic from scratch can be a useful learning exercise, these redefined operations will not be nearly as fast.\n\n"}});
