Sum Types","context":"Lean Reference\u0009Basic Types","contents":"Sum types represent a choice between two types: an element of the sum is an element of one of the other types, paired with an indication of which type it came from.\nSums are also known as disjoint unions, discriminated unions, or tagged unions.\nThe constructors of a sum are also called injections; mathematically, they can be considered as injective functions from each summand to the sum.\n\nThere are two varieties of the sum type:* Sum is polymorphic over all Type universes, and is never a proposition.* PSum is allows the summands to be propositions or types. Unlike Or, the PSum of two propositions is still a type, and non-propositional code can check which injection was used to construct a given value.Manually-written Lean code almost always uses only Sum, while PSum is used as part of the implementation of proof automation.\nThis is because it imposes problematic constraints that universe level unification cannot solve.\nIn particular, this type is in the universe Sort (max 1 u v), which can cause problems for universe level unification because the equation max 1 u v = ?u + 1 has no solution in level arithmetic.\nPSum is usually only used in automation that constructs sums of arbitrary types.\n\nThe disjoint union of types α and β, ordinarily written α ⊕ β.An element of α ⊕ β is either an a : α wrapped in Sum.inl or a b : β wrapped in Sum.inr.\nα ⊕ β is not equivalent to the set-theoretic union of α and β because its values include an\nindication of which of the two types was chosen.

This means that it can be used in situations\nwhere one side is a proposition, like True ⊕' Nat. However, the resulting universe level\nconstraints are often more difficult to solve than those that result from Sum.Left injection into the sum type α ⊕' β.Right injection into the sum type α ⊕' β.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}});
